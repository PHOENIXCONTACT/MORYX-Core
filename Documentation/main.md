# Welcome to MarvinPlatform 3.0

The Marvin Platform is our concept of the eco system in which we develop software. It originates from the original MARVIN project targeted to develop machines but has expanded to a much bigger field of use. The Marvin Platform defines a base namespace and set of interfaces used to develop modular applications.

# MaRVIN structure
